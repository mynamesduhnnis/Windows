I ran into an issue where I was needing to add an email to another mailbox as a "Send as" permissioned member. When in exchange admin trying to add the member, the email wouldn't appear.
Keep in minf that both mailboxes are licensed E1 and are shared mailboxes.
With that being said I ran some PowerShell commands to get the email address that was not appearing when searching for members to be added

1. Connect to Exchange Online via PowerShell (elivated prompt)
	Execute the following:
		Connect-ExchangeOnline

2. Once connected and authenticated run the following (be sure to replace addme@domain.com and addingto@domain.com but keep the quotes)

# Define the user and mailbox
$userToAdd = "addme@domain.com"
$targetMailbox = "addingto@domain.com"

# Grant 'Send As' permission using Add-RecipientPermission
Add-RecipientPermission -Identity $targetMailbox -Trustee $userToAdd -AccessRights SendAs

# Note: No confirmation prompt will be shown. If you wish to include confirmation, remove -Confirm:$false

3. Confirm permissions; Run the following command (be sure to replace addme@domain.com and addingto@domain.com but keep the quotes)

# Define the user and mailbox
$userToCheck = "addme@domain.com"
$mailboxToCheck = "addingto@domain.com"

# Get and confirm 'Send As' permission
$permissions = Get-RecipientPermission -Identity $mailboxToCheck | Where-Object {$_.Trustee -eq $userToCheck -and $_.AccessRights -contains "SendAs"}

if ($permissions) {
    Write-Host "The user $userToCheck has 'Send As' permission on the mailbox $mailboxToCheck."
} else {
    Write-Host "The user $userToCheck does NOT have 'Send As' permission on the mailbox $mailboxToCheck."
}
